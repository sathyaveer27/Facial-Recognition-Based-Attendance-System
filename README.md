# Facial-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. Face
recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics of a person
to identify the person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically consists of two
phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly in humans, except
under conditions where the object is located at a short distance away, the next is the intro-
duction, which recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then replicated and developed as a
model for facial image recognition (face recognition) is one of the much-studied biometrics
technology and developed by experts.


Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in perfor-
mance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for security and commercial
applications. An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for
a college to mark the attendance of their employees. So Smart Attendance using Real Time
Face Recognition is a real world solution which comes with day to day activities of handling
employees. The task is very dificult as the real time background subtraction in an image
is still a challenge. To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast Principal
Component Analysis has used to recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy rate.
The matched face is used to mark attendance of the employee. Our system maintains the
attendance records of employees automatically. Manual entering of attendance in logbooks
becomes a dificult task and it also wastes the time. So we designed an eficient module that
comprises of face recognition to manage the attendance records of employees. Our module
enrols the staffs face. This enrolling is a onetime process and their face will be stored
in the database. During enrolling of face we require a system since it is a onetime process.
You can have your own roll number as your employee id which will be unique for each em-
ployee. The presence of each employee will be updated in a database. The results showed
improved performance over manual attendance management system. Attendance is marked
after employee identification. This product gives much more solutions with accurate results
in user interactive manner rather than existing attendance and leave management systems.
